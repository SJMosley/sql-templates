# PostgresSQL Templates
Some PostgresSQL templates with inspiration coming from all over.

The templates here will require changes to work with your database, though I have tried to keep that to a minimum.

Feel free to contribute, add more templates or improve existing ones.

# My tools
I personally use [DBngin](https://dbngin.com/) and [Tableplus](https://tableplus.com/) for DB management.
Though I have used many other tools over time.

**Honorable Mentions:**
- [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/) to generate an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
